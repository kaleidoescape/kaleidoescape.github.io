    <p>I'm a natural language processing (NLP) expert with a background primarily in speech recognition and machine translation. You can view my updated <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/svetlana-tchistiakova-939a4b16/">CV on LinkedIn</a>.</p>

    <p>I've always had an interest in languages, having hopped countries with my family in my childhood, before becoming a US citizen. As a first-generation Russian-Jewish immigrant to the US, I speak English and Russian bilingually, and I continue to learn German, French, and Italian as a second language (to varying degrees of success), but I'm interested in language in general.</p>

    <p>This interest is what spurned me early on to complete my Bachelor of Arts in linguistics with a minor in Russian language from UCLA. During my undergrad, I actually studied very little about computational topics, but thanks to some awesome friends, I got pulled into the world of programming. This gave me the chance to work in computer-assisted language teaching, and eventually, in automatic speech recognition (ASR).</p>
    
    <p>From this, I learned the high level ideas behind natural language processing and computational linguistics, but realized that if I wanted to understand how it all works, I would have to dedicate some quality time with some quality books.</p>
       
    <p>The US university system was way too expensive to go at for a second round (I still had loans from the first), so I instead entered into a European double-degree program on the Erasmus Mundus scholarship. I spent my first year at University of Saarland and my second at University of Trento. That was pretty aweseome, because not only did I get to study the topic I was interesed in, but also got to travel all around Europe during those two years, and I got a full-ride scholarship to do it.</p>
    
    <p>Since then, I have chased new challenges in NLP, with my recent work focusing around speech recognition and machine translation.</p>
        
    <p>In my free time, I enjoy spending time in nature, taking aerial acrobatics classes (particularly aerial silks), traveling, learning languages, and playing video games.</p>

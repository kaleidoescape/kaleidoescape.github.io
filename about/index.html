    <h1>About</h1>
    <p>I'm a linguist turned programmer. I received a Bachelor of Arts in linguistics with a minor in Russian language from UCLA, where I studied very little about computational topics. But thanks to some awesome friends, I got pulled into the world of programming, which gave me the chance to work in computer-assisted language teaching, and eventually, in automatic speech recognition (ASR). There, I learned the high level ideas behind natural language processing and computational linguistics, but realized that if I wanted to understand how it all works, I would have to dedicate some quality time with some quality books.</p>
       
    <p>The US university system was way too expensive to go at for a second round (I still had loans from the first), so I decided to apply to the Language and Communication Technology Erasmus Mundus program in Europe. I got in, and ended up spending my first year at University of Saarland and my second at University of Trento. That was pretty aweseome, because not only did I get to study a pretty hot topic, I also got to travel all around Europe during those two years, and I got a full-ride scholarship to do it.</p>
    
    <p>I did my thesis work at FBK in Trento on the topic of speech recognition and assessment of spoken language proficiency of spontaneous speech of Italian children simultaneously learning English and German as second languages. Through this thesis work, I was finally able to answer all those questions I had had before about how ASR really works. After that, I moved to Berlin to work as an applied scientist in machine translation (MT) at a start-up, where I've gotten pretty hands-on by designing and implementing new features for MT and building up automation surrounding the machine learning pipeline.</p>

    <p>In my free time, I enjoy spending time in nature, taking aerial acrobatics classes (particularly aerial silks), traveling, and learning languages. As a first-generation Russian-Jewish immigrant to the US, I speak English and Russian bilingually, and I continue to study German, French, and Italian as a second language (to varying degrees of success). </p>

    <h1>About</h1>
    <p>I'm a linguist turned programmer. I got my bachelor's in theoretical linguistics from UCLA, where I studied very little about computational topics. But thanks to some awesome friends, I got pulled into the world of programming, and eventually landed a job in a company working on speech recognition. There, I learned the high level ideas behind natural language processing and computational linguistics, but realized that if I wanted to understand more, I would have to dedicate some quality time with some quality books. The US university system was way too expensive to go at for a second round (I still had loans from the first), so I decided to apply to the Language and Communication Technology Erasmus Mundus program in Europe. I got in, and ended up spending my first year at University of Saarland and my second at University of Trento. That was pretty aweseome, because not only did I get to study a pretty hot topic, I also got to travel all around Europe during those two years, and I got a full-ride scholarship to do it. I did my thesis work at FBK in Trento on the topic of speech recognition, and was finally able to answer all those questions I had had before. After that, I got a job in a machine translation start-up in Berlin, where I'm currently at now.
